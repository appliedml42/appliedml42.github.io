Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to appliedml85. I use this space to document my self-learning journey of applying ML to real-world problems. I have been implementing features using Machine Learning since 2011. At present, I run the Trust & Safety ML team at Tinder. Before joining Tinder, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, please reach out at appliedml85 at Gmail com.
